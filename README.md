A simple program that checks and actively tests the Internet connection.


-=========================- About Internet Tester -=========================-

Internet Tester is designed to be a quick and simple way to see if your
computer has a connection to the Internet. It does this by attempting to
ping a server. If the ping is repeatedly successful, Internet Tester will
say that the Internet is up. If anything goes wrong, or a response
to the ping requests is not received multiple times in a row, Internet
Tester will say that the Internet is down.

Ultimately, the goal of this application is to save the user from having
to go to the command prompt to check the Internet connection.
